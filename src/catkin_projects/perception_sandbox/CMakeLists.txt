# While this library relies on PCL and OpenCV, they are brought in

# OpenCV and PCL. In the current configuration, these are close enough that
# this doesn't pose an issue. If you want to involve Drake in a node
# like this down the road, see
# https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-shambhala/issues/38
# for some ideas of how to resolve the Eigen compatibility issues you'll have.
