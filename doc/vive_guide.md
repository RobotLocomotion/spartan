# Vive Teleop
This is a guide to using the HTC vive headset and controllers to teleop the robot in simulation or using hardware.

# Prerequisites for VR computer
- Follow the [HTC Vive Installation Guide](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2001-UXCM-4439)
- Install [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and SteamVR
- Clone spartan

# Prerequisites for robot computer (run on same computer if using simulation)
- Install spartan using docker

# Install required packages (VR computer)
Run the following commands to install required packages
```
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libvulkan-dev libsdl2-dev libglfw3-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev python-pip ros-kinetic-tf ros-kinetic-tf2*

pip install openvr
```

Additionally, clone the [OpenVR repository](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) into a known location

# Install ROS Plugins using catkin (VR computer)
The Plugin is build using catkin. You have to create a catkin workspace first. Open up a terminal and:
```
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
```

Next clone the [RVIZ Plugin](https://github.com/jmcculloch2018/rviz_vive) and the [Controller Tracking Node](https://github.com/jmcculloch2018/htc_vive_teleop_stuff) into the src folder.

After cloning the RVIZ Plugin, open the *CMakeLists.txt* file in the *rviz_vive* folder and change the OpenVR path in line 30 to the location that you cloned OpenVR to.

Finally, build the plugins and source them
```
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
# Run Vive Teleop Simulation
1. Start SteamVR and ensure that headset and controllers are tracking
2. In a new terminal, navigate to your spartan directory
  - `./setup/docker/docker_run.py -nethost`
  - In docker, start procman and run start simulation
  - Through procman start the process *vive-teleop*
3. In a new terminal, navigate to your catkin workspace
  - `source devel/setup.bash`
  - `roslaunch htc_vive_teleop_stuff htc_vive_tf_and_joy.launch`
4. Close the instance of rviz opened by procman
5. In a new terminal, navigate to your catkin workspace
  - `source devel/setup.bash`
  - cd to your spartan folder and run `source build/setup_environment.sh`
  - `rosrun rviz rviz -d $SPARTAN_SOURCE_DIR/src/catkin_projects/station_config/RLG_iiwa_1/rviz_vive.rviz`
6. Put on the vive headset and look around. Press and hold the trackpad to move the arm and hold the trigger to close the gripper. Press the menu button (above trackpad) to play / pause point clouds.

# Run Vive Teleop on Robot
On robot computer:
1. Run `hostname -I` and look at the first entry to determine your ip address (should be 128.30.27.155 for kuka2). Write this number anywhere you see ROBOT_IP_HERE.
1. Navigate to your spartan directory and run `./setup/docker/docker_run.py -nethost`
2. Run `export ROS_IP=ROBOT_IP_HERE`
3. Start procman and set up robot normally
4. Through procman start the process *vive-teleop*

On VR computer:
1. Run `hostname -I` and look at the first entry to determine your ip address (should be 128.30.xx.xxx). Write this number anywhere you see VR_IP_HERE.
2. Start SteamVR and ensure that headset and controllers are tracking
3. In a new terminal, navigate to your catkin workspace
  1. `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ROBOT_IP_HERE:11311`
  2. `export ROS_IP=VR_IP_HERE`
  3. `source devel/setup.bash`
  4. `roslaunch htc_vive_teleop_stuff htc_vive_tf_and_joy.launch`
4. In a new terminal, navigate to your catkin workspace
  1. `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ROBOT_IP_HERE:11311`
  2. `export ROS_IP=VR_IP_HERE`
  3. `source devel/setup.bash`
  4. cd to your spartan folder and run `source build/setup_environment.sh`
  5. `rosrun rviz rviz -d $SPARTAN_SOURCE_DIR/src/catkin_projects/station_config/RLG_iiwa_1/rviz_vive.rviz`
5. Put on the vive headset and look around. Press and hold the trackpad to move the arm and hold the trigger to close the gripper. Press the menu button (above trackpad) to play / pause point clouds.
